# 15-cb002ne-hackintosh
EFI Folder for my HP Pavilion Power 15-cb002ne hackintosh.

Followed the oc-laptop-guide by 1Revenger1. 
Used OpenCore 0.5.7. 
Patched the DSDT using the battery patch for hp pavilion n012tx from rehabman's repo to get the battery indicator fixed. 
Bought the tp-link Archer T2U since I saw in their website that it has drivers for macOS until 10.15.
